# JavaPrep

Welcome to my personal learning repository

This repo is a daily log of my journey learning Java, Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and tackling LeetCode coding questions. Here, I organize and push everything I learn—notes, code solutions, and explanations—so I can track my progress and help others who are preparing for interviews or just want to boost their Java and problem-solving skills.

## About

- **Personal Repository:** This is my space to document what I learn every day.
- **Topics Covered:** Java fundamentals, DSA concepts, LeetCode questions (with solutions), and interview notes.
- **Goal:** To build a strong foundation in Java and problem-solving, and to make my learning resources accessible for revision and sharing.

## Repository Structure

- `dsa/` — Data Structures & Algorithms explanations and solutions
- `leetcode/` — My solutions to LeetCode problems
- `src/` — Java code samples where you find all things in organized manner.

## How to Use

1. **Browse by Topic:** Use the folders to find explanations, solutions, and notes.
2. **Java Code:** Run `.java` files using your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.).
3. **Practice:** Try solving the questions yourself before checking my solutions!

## Why This Repo?

- Track my daily progress and learning
- Organize DSA and LeetCode solutions for easy reference
- Share knowledge and help others preparing for interviews
